The app is a "tic tac toe" game.

Reminder of the 8 behaviors expected from the program (in order of importance):

- The game can only be played with two human players (we are not asking you to code artificial intelligence todayâ€¦);

- The program must start by asking for the first name of each player;

- The game board is made up of 9 squares, each designated by its vertical position (A, B or C) followed by its horizontal position (1, 2 or 3). 
Examples: the box at the top right is called "A3" and the one at the bottom right "C3";

- At the start of each game turn, the program displays the game board in the terminal. 
Then it asks the player whose turn it is to play;

- Players take turns playing until one of them wins or the game board is full;

- The program must detect the end of the game. If a player wins, the game announces his name. 
If there is a draw, the program must inform both players;

- At the end of a game, the program must offer to start a new game

- A nice display of the game in the terminal is expected (eg: board displayed in a stylish way, game counter, colors, etc.).
